# Make Life Great

[[2021-04-04]]
to change your life dramatically, first you have to be awake, you haven't even noticed you have been sleepwalking your whole life, u perform tasks on not notice.... so first thing first you have to be awake. Remember """ you cannot reach somewhere where you are not  going and know where you  are going""" so you have to mark out somewhere you want to go... places where you see yourself part of, financial freedom, hundreds of billions  of dollars, luxurios homes, might be sporting achievements, maybe you want to lift some trophy... fine...,  Then carve out a simple path from where you are to where you want to be... then start walking and Remember what [[RUMI]] said 
“As you start to walk on the way, the way appears.”
then on the way you will find lots and lots of hurdles thats normal, they might  seem like stumbling stone before you pass it after you  pass it you will see them as stepping stone taking you higher and higher... 
make sure you don't stop and keep going and keep going and keep on going...
remember it might seem like you have come farther then your peers and everyone around you but the real competition of yours is somewhere in Japan, Alaska, or somewhere else...

and remember some more things:
remember to learn more and more things along the way as Abraham Lincon said  “ Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the ax. ” being effective in your work is a productivity multiplier 

3) “Don’t Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much Of Today.” – Will Rogers





and you will definitely walk in your $4 billion dollar yatch like a boss...
