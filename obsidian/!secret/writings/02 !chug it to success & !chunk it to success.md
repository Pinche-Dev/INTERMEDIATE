marvelous machines and programmes around us in this century super fiter jets to computer programmes such as Linux,Windows,OS X And without even going to depth we find that they are made of up small parts some function independently whereas other function combined to perform the desired tasks. Fighter jets such as F-35 Lightning ll composites of millions of parts as weall as advanced computer programmes used for putting all the components into action.
Even the most complicated of the programmes can be broken down into categories in case of Fighter Jets: Engines, Manned area, Attack Systems, Stealth, Radars,... and each segments can further catagorized into small systems...

first thing you have to do is  set out a quest, a destination where you want to reach after some years then draw a sketch, a roadmap to reach there. As it is going to be a long journey to reach there it can be broken down into smaller chunks. most of the time chunks can be catazorized into chronological order and not doing in order wouldn't make sense as leraning advanced topics before without basic doesn't make sense. a lot of important things get added and some have to be reomoved. And be sure that you are commited and give some time and whatever you want to achieve will be achieved.

Its about excelling in one thing  ,  ignoring most of the main stream things , delegating whatever it can be, making most out of today and days to come and 
 if (anySetbacks){
	getBackToTrack() 
}

"making most out of today is the best habit you are going to have ever in  your life" [[quotes]]
