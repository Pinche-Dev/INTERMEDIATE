- Have a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset
- Depend on your drive and not on your Motivation because when you are in a challenging situation motivation will get you nowhere
- Develop habits ( like streaking ) because habits will help you to maintain consistency and help you to prevent procrastination
- Improve your physical and mental health. Go out and exercise regularly, eat healthy food and maintain a good posture while studying
- Be very careful with burnouts. Make sure not to push hard enough which will make you burnout and if you face burnout try to understand what caused it and correct it the next time.
- Have clear aspirations. Aspirations will help you to push forward and make you realise why you are studying so hard.
This is all I can remember...if he said something I did not add feel free to mention it!
