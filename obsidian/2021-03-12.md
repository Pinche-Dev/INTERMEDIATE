reading some books while the internet is down is good for the helth I was sooo deepely immersed into the story of the Cuban missile crisis in the book [[StillnessIsTheKey]] by Ryan holiday and how JFK handled it with calmness when the whole world was on the brink of nuclear war. And one key note is to have a journal and peace of mind and stillness is the key as it helps you triumphs...

Stillness helps you alot, it helps you get focoused on your craft and being prsent and give 110% to your carft which will bring fruitful results, it also helps you think and think deeper and give time to innovate and create a better world for you and other people around you, decluttering your life in many ways helps you make room for Gratitude and see the world in a positive way .

[[GoodThoughts]] "the Universe is silence and more silence and if you really want to find more about Universe and know its secrets then silence is the Key"" :) Nikola Tesla would have liked it...

## Thoughts burden or blessing???

## thanks god for not creating two mouths for beings in thins universe... avoided tragedy

Zen philosophy, a philosophy that finds fullness in emptiness.

absence of voices
