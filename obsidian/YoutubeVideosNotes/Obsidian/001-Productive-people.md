# 7 Things Organized People Do That You (Probably) Don't Do

1. Don't Rely too much on their brain to store information
2. Label All Things (that need labeling)
3. Build a Mindfulness Loop
4. Have a backup (2 is 1, 1 is none)
5. Organizing by Experience, not by dogma
6. Respect the phrase "mise en place"
7. Be deliberate about the things you own
