C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

Object-Oriented Programming
C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development −

Encapsulation
Data hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Standard Libraries
Standard C++ consists of three important parts −

The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.

The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.

The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.
