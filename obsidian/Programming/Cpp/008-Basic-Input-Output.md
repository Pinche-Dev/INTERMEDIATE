# Input Output
C++ I/O occurs in streams, which are sequences of bytes. If bytes flow from a device like a keyboard, a disk drive, or a network connection etc. to main memory, this is called input operation and if bytes flow from main memory to a device like a display screen, a printer, a disk drive, or a network connection, etc., this is called output operation.

## I/O Library Header Files
There are following header files important to C++ programs âˆ’

<iostream>
This file defines the cin, cout, cerr and clog objects, which correspond to the standard input stream, the standard output stream, the un-buffered standard error stream and the buffered standard error stream, respectively.

<iomanip>
This file declares services useful for performing formatted I/O with so-called parameterized stream manipulators, such as setw and setprecision.

<fstream>
This file declares services for user-controlled file processing. We will discuss about it in detail in File and Stream related chapter.
