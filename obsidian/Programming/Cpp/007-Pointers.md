# Pointers

C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.

What are Pointers?
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is âˆ’


Sr.No	Concept & Description
1	Null Pointers
C++ supports null pointer, which is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.

2	Pointer Arithmetic
There are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, -

3	Pointers vs Arrays
There is a close relationship between pointers and arrays.

4	Array of Pointers
You can define arrays to hold a number of pointers.

5	Pointer to Pointer
C++ allows you to have pointer on a pointer and so on.

6	Passing Pointers to Functions
Passing an argument by reference or by address both enable the passed argument to be changed in the calling function by the called function.

7	Return Pointer from Functions
C++ allows a function to return a pointer to local variable, static variable and dynamically allocated memory as well.
