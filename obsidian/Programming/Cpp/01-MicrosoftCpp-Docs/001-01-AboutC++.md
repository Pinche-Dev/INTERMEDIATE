About c++
- c++ programs are fast and efficient
- from highest level of abstraction to down to sillicion
- maximizes speed and minmizes memory consumptoin
- from embedded devices to modern massive computing applications
- great standard library
 

- backward compatibility with C
- makes it possible to use C style programming

- Modern c++ is faster, simpler , more reliable...

- C++ is a _strongly typed_ language and it is also _statically-typed_; every object has a type and that type never changes (not to be confused with static data objects). When you declare a variable in your code, you must either specify its type explicitly, or use the **`auto`** keyword to instruct the compiler to deduce the type from the initializer.
