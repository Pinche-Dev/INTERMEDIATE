Pointer : Variable that stores adress of another variable
Adresses of Memory: Memory is divided into uniform chunk such as bytes, one unit is a address of memory

How to get adress of a variable??
-> by putting '&' in  front of a variable name
int /* pointer1 = &variable1;
-> address is usually in hex

### More about pointers??
simply pointer is a variable which is  used to store address of other variables... there are different types of pointers, such as int, char, bool ,etc for storing address of int, char, bool respectively

you can do arithemetic with pointers which is **pointer arithemetic**




### Dereferencing 
suppose a int pointer 'p1' is  pointing to a integer 'int1' if we print '/*p1' then it will print the value of int1...
