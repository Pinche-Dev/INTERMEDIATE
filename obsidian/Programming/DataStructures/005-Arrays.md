A static array is a fixed length containing n length element from range \[0,n-1]... They are indexable which means that each slot can be referenced with numbers

## When and where is static arrays used???
- storing and acessing sequantial data
- Temporialy storing objects
- used by IO routines as buffers
- Lookups tables and inverse lookup tables
- can be used to return multiple values from a function
- used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems

## operations on dynamic Arrays
dynamic arrays can grow and shrink in size

static array: int static_arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5} //this is a static element with number of elements 5

dynamic array: int dynamic_arr[ ]={1,2,3,4,5,6,6}  //this is a dynamic array
