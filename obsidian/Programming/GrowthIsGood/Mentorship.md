# Mentorship

It's important to find a mentor who is willing and able to take you on. A good mentor is someone who will support and encourage you to reach for higher goals, to take the next step and to push yourself in to succeed in business.
 The perfect mentor is one who is experienced in an area where you need a little bit of extra help because you may lack the knowledge or experience.
 A good mentor will help you stay accountable to your goals, they will help you pay attention and stay on track
 Mentors are invaluable for so many reasons, but essential for providing knowledge, motivation, advice and counsel, encouragement when you need it most, help with personal development and so much more.
