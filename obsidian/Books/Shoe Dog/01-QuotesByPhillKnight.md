“Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.”

“The cowards never started and the weak died along the way -- that leaves us.” -- Phil Knight

“Let everyone else call your idea crazy... Just keep going. Don’t stop. Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and don’t give much thought to where ‘there’ is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop.” -- Phil Knight

“You are remembered for the rules you break.” -- Phil Knight

“The art of competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting... You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. You must forget that internal voice, screaming, begging, ‘Not one more step!’” -- Phil Knight

“How can I leave my mark on the world unless I get out there first and see it? Before running a big race, you always want to walk the track.” -- Phil Knight

“Life is growth. You grow or you die.” -- Phil Knight

“Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.” -- Phil Knight

“Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt.” -- Phil Knight

“Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart.” -- Phil Knight

“Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.” -- Phil Knight
