Demand more of yourself in every aspect of your life
It doesnot matter what your family might call you it only matters that you successed
OBSESSION is the most that you can give to yourself

Think about what great Athlees and business person where be without their OBSESSION, All great men have put in hours and hours of work to become the best in their field, it requires Obsession for the great things to happen , thats why there are so less people who have made their name and actions LEGENDARY

All the people who have successed in life have one thing in common they are obsessed, think of any athlee -> what they talk about is spending day and night in they gym and training hall, doing more than others were doing thats why they are able to have such a good life for them 

OBSTACLE is the way OBSESSION is the fuel

I would rather be OBsessed and successful than not



I have a ADDICTION to success no matter what I will achieve SUCCESSES IN MY LIFE
