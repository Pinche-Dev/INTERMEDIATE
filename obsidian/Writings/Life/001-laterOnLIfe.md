# Real Thoughts

I don't enjoy using pirated books from z-lib.org I reallly really dont feell good about it later I am making multiple learning places in Nepal and other parts of the world to help people learn coding and programming for free and I am buying them lots and lots of books 
I have to use those pirated books as I obligation and I have to do it as I want to becomme successful and there is one way for me now.... I know it is going to change in future...
