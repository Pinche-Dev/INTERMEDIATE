## journal 
I was rushed to the ER in KMC hospital, it was 3 AM while we left the home and 3:45AM when we reached there... WHile in the ER I recieved proper medical care, I recieved Sline Pani for 4 hrs and they performed X ray and ECG and other things and then good hearted kind doctord treated me well and cared me.... It was 8 AM while i was dischared and then called again for 11:30 AM where there were more consultatioon and various other things ....

They thought that my difficulty in breathing was due to past complication with Depression and anxiety for over 2 years which started in 2018 so recieved medication
